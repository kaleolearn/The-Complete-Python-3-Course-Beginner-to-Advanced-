Difference between an interpreted programming language and compiled programming languages

COMPILED: 
  write code, 
  save in a file, 
  but can't run that code yet. 
  You need to compile that code into binary. 

INTERPRETER: 
  write code, 
  save in a file, 
  AND immediately have the computer understand it when you run the code.
  No need to compile it into binary.
