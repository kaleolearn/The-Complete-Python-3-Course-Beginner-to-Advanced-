you can actually code using notepad ++ and run it into command prompt, but it's not as efficient as using an IDE.

IDE (integrated development environment)

How to get the IDE "Pycharm"
  1. Google search "Pycharm"
  2. Download the community version of Pycharm. (It's free).
  
Using Pycharm
  1. Launch Pycharm
  2. Click "create a new project"
  3. Name the project "First Program" and hit create.
    - on the left, you see all the django, bootstrap, etc. We'll get to that later (i hope).
  4. Go to the "project view" window on the left side, right click on "first project" and create a new file.
  5. Name the file "main".
  6. Go to view -> tool windows
    -> project (command + 1) toggles the project side bar on the left side
    -> "python console" opens up the python console.
    -> "terminal" opens terminal
    
How to run stuff
  1. Go to run -> click on run
  2. click on edit configurations
  3. hit the plus sign on top left corner
  4. choose python
  5. name the config "python run"
  6. change the script to "main.py" or whatever script you want it to run
  7. Click "apply" on bottom right -> click "run"
